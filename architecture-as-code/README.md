# Architecture as Code

> Modeling, enforcing, and evolving software architecture using **executable, version-controlled code** not just diagrams or prose.

---

## Why It Matters

- Automates detection of **architectural drift** and violations.
- Treats architecture as **testable policies** integrated in CI/CD workflows.
- Ensures **fast feedback**, measurable governance, and alignment with business goals.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Fitness Functions**
- Codified checks for architectural qualities (e.g., performance, security, resilience).
- Run in CI to validate architecture after every change.
- Examples include measuring cyclomatic complexity, latency thresholds, or absence of forbidden dependencies.

### 2. **Lightweight Architecture Definition**
- Use a minimal, platform-agnostic language to define architecture models and constraints.
- Generates code for fitness functions in any implementation language.
- Acts like an "executable specification" across teams and platforms.

### 3. **Automation & Governance**
- Integrate architecture tests in pipelines to **gate merges** on compliance.
- Combine with **infra-as-code**, observability, and service meshes to validate real-time constraints.

## Typical Workflow

1. **Define** architecture in code (DSL or ADL).
2. **Generate** fitness-function tests from definitions.
3. **Run** tests and checks in CI/CD after each change.
4. **Monitor results**, block violation-inducing merges, and iterate fast.

## Origins & Use Cases

- **"Architecture as Code: Objective Measures of Value in a Changing World"** (O'Reilly 2019) introduced fitness‑driven architecture through DSL‑to‑tests transformations.
- Podcast discussions featuring architecture definition languages and CI‑based enforcement have built significant context for these practices.

## ✅ Summary

| Benefit         | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Testable        | Architecture becomes code you can validate automatically |
| Governable      | CI/CD ensures compliance and fast response to violations |
| Platform-agnostic | Constraints defined once, enforced across multiple ecosystems |
| Measurable      | Fitness functions offer clear, objective feedback |

---

## Getting Started

- Choose a definition format (e.g. DSL, JSON, YAML).
- Draft your architectural constraints and diagram elements.
- Auto-generate tests and plug them into your CI.
- Observe feedback and evolve your architecture continually.
